## Bio

Hello, my name is Kadija Mussa! 

I am a Ph.D. student in Family Social Science specializing in Couples and Family Therapy. I am also working on a minor in data Analytics in the Education Psychology Department at the University of Minnesota. My research interest is in the experience of East African Immigrants in America. I use both qualitative and quantitative data to look at population level and interpersonal relationships. 

In my free time I love to read and volunteering on different professional boards. I am currently looking to learn all about programming to be industry ready!
